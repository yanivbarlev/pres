    "# Summary:\n",
    "Our poroject is based on the 2008 \"KKBOX Churn prediction challange\" \n",
    "(https://www.kaggle.com/c/kkbox-churn-prediction-challenge)\n",
    "\n",
    "[KKBOX](https://www.kkbox.com/intl/) is a music streaming application. They offer a free and premium (paid) subscriptions. \n",
    "We will be using various predictive models in order to attempt to predict the likelihood of a cusotmer's churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The importance of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "*[\"...it can cost five times more to attract a new customer, than it does to retain an existing one.\"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/09/12/dont-spend-5-times-more-attracting-new-customers-nurture-the-existing-ones/#5f14e1975a8e).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for most businesses the ability to retain customers is essential in order to increase profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a subscription-based business, such as KKBOX, client Lifetime Value (LTV) is essentially based on the amount of time the user keeps paying for the service. \n",
    "A higher client value would give KKBOX a major competitive edge. \n",
    "It would allow an increase in Marketing expenditures (a higher customer value means they can spend more per client acquisition) and recruit more customers with higher profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the project will allow KKBOX to devise marketing & product initiatives that will help combat churn and grow their paying customers base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the KKBOX offers both free and paid subscriptions, their business model is dependent on their ability to forecast users' churn. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start off with exploratory data anlysis: detect noise, distributions, correlations, NA etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will move to feature selection to decide which variables are meaningful as well as create new variables with added value based on the data at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
